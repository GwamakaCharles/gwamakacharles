### About Me

I am a Full-stack Software engineer with more than _ years of experience. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering and my tech-stack consists of _Python, Typescript, Django, React, React Native, GraphQL, NestJS, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Microsoft Azure and SQL Databases_. My passion is to build _distributed software systems with mobile and web clients_ and I would love to work in a company that develops distributed computing systems in their products so that I can apply my knowledge with the support of talented co-workers. I would love to become a leader in tech someday and I am learning that now. One interesting fact about me is that _I am a music DJ_ and I love to do that whenever I get a chance.

### Music DJ to Software Development

Right after college I decided to practice music dj'ing but I wasn't committed to it because I loved coding. And so I started to learn programming online, mostly at [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com), [Datacamp](https://datacamp.com) and [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com). I would build websites for [Interfrempa](https://interfrempacompanyltd.co.tz) and [Piminnovators](https://piminnovators.co.tz) and then [my website](https://gwamakacharles.netlify.app) where I posted my [Portfolio](https://gwamakacharles.netlify.app/projects) of projects I have been working on.

### Cloud Computing and Serverless Technologies

Two years ago I started to learn about Cloud Computing, and through the [Students - GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/students) program, I was able to subscribe to <u>[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/)</u> where I learned about the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Then I created a free account on [Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Cloud Computing Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) to learn about Nodejs deployment and how different it is from other cloud providers. I struggled with <u>docker containers and Kubernetes deployments</u> on AWS and so I decided to use <u>Azure Kubernetes Service</u> for that.

### Mobile Apps Development

I started mobile apps development 2 years ago with Flutter and React Native. I use React Native because it is easier to use the React knowledge that I have and therefore I tend to re-use most of the code I write for either a website or a mobile app. Plus, this decision becomes effective when I write the backend in TypeScript and GraphQL.

### Hackathons and Bootcamps

1. ### Build For Sustainable Development Goals Challenge - April 2019

   I was selected to participate in the [#BuildforSDG Challenge with Andela and Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/success-stories/andela/). I was part of the team that built an [online machine learning primer notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GwamakaCharles/applied-machine-learning/blob/main/applied-machine-learning.ipynb) to teach computer science students the concepts of machine learning. We used Python and the Jupyter notebook platforms.

2. ### Jim Leech Mastercard Foundation Fellowship - November 2020
   I was selected to participate in the [Jim Leech Mastercard Foundation Fellowship on Entrepreneurship | Queen's Innovation Centre (queensu.ca)](https://www.queensu.ca/innovationcentre/jim-leech-fellowship) where I tried to build a food delivery services startup. I used Typescript, Docker, Kubernetes, React Native, GraphQL, Azure Cache for Redis and Azure PostgreSQL technologies to build mobile and web clients and deployed the backend to Microsoft Azure. My startup was not selected amog the final 10! but I learned a lot about entrepreneurship, leadership and cloud technologies.
